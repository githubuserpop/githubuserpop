### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm pop (withholding my name for privacy reasons), and I am currently a student at Georgia State University pursuing a BA in Computer Science, with no current concentration and minor as of right now.

I have an interest in programming, and although I currently do not know what direction I want to head in in the CS field, I'm branching out as much as possible in different areas so that I can get a feel for things and eventually find my interest. Currently, I'm learning Rust, as I've heard only great things about it online from people in the field. I'm also planning on learning JS (focusing on maybe node as well) soon so that I can have a solid collection of programming languages that I know well or understand well enough under my belt. Currently, I have learned Python, Java, x86 ASM, and C, with Python being my preferred language of choice, and the others not being utilized at all as I do not enjoy working with them.

This page is still being worked on as of now so don't be disappointed in the lack of content in this read me.
